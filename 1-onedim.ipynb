    "The last bit we need is to define the measurement we want the Monte Carlo simulator to make. We will compute the top-of-atmosphere bidirectional reflectance factor (TOA BRF). This is done using a *distant radiometer*, an abstract measurement which, in practice, computes the radiance leaving the scene at an infinite distance. It is done with the [`MultiDistantMeasure` class](https://eradiate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rst/reference/generated/autosummary/eradiate.scenes.measure.MultiDistantMeasure.html). This class can be constructed in several ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* one may pass directions manually using its basic constructor;\n",
    "* one may specify directions using viewing angles using the `from_viewing_angles()` class method constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the second possibility, which feels more natural for Earth observation-related applications. The `from_viewing_angles()` has two main arguments `zeniths` and `azimuths`. By default, both must be arrays of the same size, each element being the zenith (resp. azimuth) value of a zenith-azimuth pair. If all pairs have the same zenith (resp. azimuth) value, then a scalar value may be passed as the zenith (resp. azimuth).\n",
    "\n",
    "The second important parametrisation point of our measure is its spectral configuration. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The instrument's spectral response function. Importantly, this will determine the spectral range the measure will process. Eradiate has a number of instrument spectral response functions to choose from, and we will select a rather [narrow band of Sentinel-2](https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi/document-library/-/asset_publisher/Wk0TKajiISaR/content/sentinel-2a-spectral-responses) (narrower bands are quicker to process).\n",
    "* In CKD mode, the discretisation used for the spectral domain. Eradiate currently ships pre-computed gaseous absorption data for 1 nm and 10 nm-wide spectral bins. Narrower bins yield more accurate results, but they also require more computational resources to cover a given spectral range. For this example, we will use the 10 nm discretisation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we have to define the number of radiance samples the Monte Carlo will accumulate to compute this BRF. The computational time is highly dependent on this number, and we will first set it to the default 1000—arguably a low number, which we can increase later on to reduce the amount of noise in our results."
